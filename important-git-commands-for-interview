git pull -                                downloads and immediately merges those changes into your current branch.
git fetch -                               downloads remote changes without modifying your local branch
git stash -                               temporarily saves your unfinished changes aside so you can switch branches or pull updates, and restore them later.
git stash pop -                           restores your most recently stashed changes back to your working directory and removes them from the stash list.
git revert -                              Creates a new commit that reverses the changes of a selected commit.
                                          Does not delete history — keeps a full audit trail.
git reset -                               Moves the branch pointer to an earlier commit.
                                          Can remove commits and changes from history.
git merge -                               combines two branches and keeps the original history (creates a merge commit).
git rebase -                              moves your branch on top of another branch and rewrites history to keep it linear.
